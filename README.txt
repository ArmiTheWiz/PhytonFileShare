Service.Announcer and P2P.Server should be in the same folder as the files that desired to send

Service.Listener and P2P.Downloader should be in the same folder but seperate from Announcer and Server.

How to run the code 
(In order to run this code python 3.7 or newer version should be installed on the computer)
1) Run Service.Listener and Service.Announcer
2) Servic.Announcer will ask you your username, enter anything you want.
3) Check the console for broadcast message and check the folder of Service.Listener to create log.txt file
				(log.txt file contains broadcast ip, username and files that can be sent)
4) Run P2P.Server first and then P2P.Downloader
5) Eneter the file you want to download from server on P2P.Downloader console (with extension .txt)
6) Enter the file that demanded from downloader on P2P.Server (with extension .txt)

If connected to Hamachi or similar virtual private network it is possible to send or recieve files from another local area network.
In that case ip adress to enter on console will be the ip of virtual private network.
